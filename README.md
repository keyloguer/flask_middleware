Library provides a connector with annotations that makes possible to check the integrity of a jwt token in a microservice architecture. <br>
Developed to make it easier to validade and work with JWT Authentication on a Flask micro-framework. 

## App Configuration

Example on how to set your flask app configuration: 

| app.config | possibles values |
|------------|------------------|
|MIDDLEWARE_URL_IDENTITY| http://0.0.0.0:5000 |
|MIDDLEWARE_VERIFY_ENDPOINT | /path_to_you_endpoint/verify |
|MIDDLEWARE_BEARER | True or False |
|MIDDLEWARE_VERIFY_HTTP_VERB | GET or POST |
|JWT_SECRET | your secret |


## Annotations

### JWT Token
@middleware_jwt_required 

Validates initially if tokens via headers in requests contains "Autorization" before your jwt token and returns an invalid token message otherwise. 

## Example - How to run

To start your app, please follow these instructions: <br>
Navigate to the <strong>'example' directory</strong> and execute either of the following commands on <strong>both</strong> 'identity' and 'your_app' folders: 
>flask run

or 

>python3 app.py 

Once both services are up and running, use your prefered API Client, such as Postman to test your app.
